There are a few options to deal with previous patents and copyrights granted:

The first is that existing monopoly rights such as patents and copyrights would be abolished, new remuneration rights would be available, and the new, open, model would go into operation. This is simplest but least plausible. 

If there isnâ€™t such a big-bang approach, the key question how would all the existing patents and copyrights be handled? One possible solution is that patents and copyrights would remain in place and remuneration rights would only be granted to new innovations. 

If remuneration rights apply retrospectively, then previously awarded patents and copyrights need to be converted on an agreed basis. This could be done with or without compensation. Compensation would ensure major interest groups do not lose out from the transition. 

The key to political feasibility here is keeping vested interests happy. The social gains from the change would be large, but given the lobbying power of big business in western democracies, at the beginning remuneration rights funding would need to be at at a comparable level to what they were earning with patents.
