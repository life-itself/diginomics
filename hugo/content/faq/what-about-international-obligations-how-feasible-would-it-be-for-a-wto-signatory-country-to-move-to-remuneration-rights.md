The US and many other countries are signatories to treaties such as the World Trade Organizationâ€™s TRIPs agreement (on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights), which require provision and recognition of monopoly rights. How is this obstacle to be negotiated? First, experience shows that countries, especially large ones such
as the US, can often change or work around their international obligations
with surprising rapidity if it is in their interest to do so. Next, domestic
companies can continue to obtain patents and other monopoly rights in
countries that continue to recognize them. In return, the US would permit
foreign firms to obtain remuneration rights on the same basis as domestic
companies. 

But what if it proved impossible to abolish monopoly rights fully?
In this case, remuneration rights could existing in parallel to monopoly rights,
with innovators having to choose one or the other. Remuneration rights
could be made highly attractive relative to monopoly rights in a variety of
ways. First, one would create a large remuneration rights fund which would
mean the rewards under remuneration rights are high. Whilst
this opt-in approach is less attractive than a full transition, it might be useful
in cases where abolition of monopoly rights is not feasible in the short term,
for political or legal reasons.
