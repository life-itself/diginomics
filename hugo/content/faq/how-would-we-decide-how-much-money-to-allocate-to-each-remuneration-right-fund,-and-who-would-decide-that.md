title: How would we decide how much money to allocate to each remuneration right fund, and who would decide that?

The basic question of how much of our financial resources (money) we should allocate to creating new information goods is hard to answer. Ultimately it depends upon an assessment of the relative value we derive from new medicines, new apps and new
movies and how that compares to other things we need or like such as schools
and roads or cars and holidays. But this challenge is neither new nor specific to information goods. 

One starting point would be the size of the existing market (which is the current reflection of the value economically, socially and politically). The actual size of the remuneration fund would then be adjusted depending on societal preferences.

The body making this decision would need to be independent of producers and consumers as well being shielded from political interference (yet accountable democratically). There are many organisations that have been set up with this guiding principles (e.g. electoral commission in the UK, European Central Bank and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the United States) so there something to build on and learn from (as often ‘independent’ bodies have become politicised - this is an issue but one that is not unsurmountable).

The critically minded may argue that starting with the current market size is the wrong place to start; why would you use valuation of the old Closed system to determine the value ascribed to the new Open system? And that would be a good point! 

It is possible to start with a blank sheet and determine remuneration rights for each sector. To do this properly we need to quantify the marginal value of spending, that is, the value derived from spending an additional dollar of public money in this way or that. Concretely at a high-level we are asking ourselves the value of 10 new schools versus a new hospital and at a marginal level, the value of one more desk at school or a bed in a hospital. A pseudo-price mechanism would need to be created and it would be used to allocate between areas. Essentially it would estimate the value to citizens of new schools versus new hospitals, or the value to users of listening to music compared to the value of pharmaceuticals. and then use that to allocate funds. This has the challenge of commensurability. Using the music versus pharmaseticals as an example whilst there is the agreed approach of [Quality-adjusted life year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year) as a sort of price mechanism to compare between pharmaceuticals it is not obvious at this stage what an agreed common yardstick that compares music to pharmaceuticals. 

Whilst considering these important technical and philosophical challenges, it’s important to realise the current system does no better at ascribing value between and within areas - and we would argue a lot worse. Because of the nature of information goods (infinite economies of scale, complementarity, platform effects etc) combined with monopoly rights (which cause market distortions) we already have a broken system of market prices and misallocation of resources. 

Deciding how much money to allocate to each remuneration right fund is not an easy task, but it is well within the bounds of human ingenuity and it is possible to implement in practice, and, crucially, the outcomes of an Open world would be far better than the current system.
