The Open Revolution vision will create a more innovative and entrepreneurial world. There is no intention or need for the entity that administers the remuneration fund to actually provide the service. Take the music industry as example. Companies/cooperatives would provide similar services to Spotify. These companies/cooperatives would provide the platform/product to listen to music, but instead of paying the labels/publishers for the right to use their music catalogue, they would pay the remuneration fund that would in turn would pay the labels/publishers and independents based on an agreed distribution (probably in function of number of plays). These companies/cooperatives could obtain revenue from users (or another software remuneration rights pool) to use their services but this would be a fraction of the current cost which largely reflects the cost of compensating rights holders for their monopoly right.
