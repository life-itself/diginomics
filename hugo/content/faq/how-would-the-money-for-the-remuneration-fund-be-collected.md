There are different models available to fund the remuneration fund. Funding could be collected from both private and state sources. 

The government could use taxation and levies on goods and services (similar to existing value-added taxes) to collect the monies. These levies would be best attached to specific goods or services, usually with a strong informational aspect, for three reasons. First, dedicating a particular levy to the creation of a specific type of information – a broadband levy going to fund music and movies, for instance – feels instinctively fair and appropriate. Second, open information makes digital devices such as computers and internet services more valuable, because the more information they can access, the more valuable they are. Third, demand for these services and devices is probably quite inelastic (i.e., demand does not vary so much with price), so a small tax or levy would be efficient, in that it would be unlikely to distort behaviour and so create deadweight losses (i.e. cost to society created by market inefficiency).

An open world would, no doubt, be partly funded from private sources. Some of these
would anticipate no direct return, including large philanthropic bodies with
existing funds (large Bill Gates donation to help cure malaria), and pro-bono contributions individual motivated either by specific interests, personal need (such as user-driven open innovation) or a concern for the general welfare. Wikipedia is an example of all three. Other non-government bodies would contribute to an open world in expectation of a private financial return, usually from selling some kind of complementary goods. Classic examples are open-source software, consulting and bespoke commissions.
