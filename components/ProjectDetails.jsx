            This project offers a guide to what makes the digital economy so unique, and a practical toolkit to making it work. 
            Diginomics refer to the rules of the digital economy, and the specific approach to economics they require.
            It can be used for everything from policymaking to funding open source software to supporting more and better 
            data sharing across value chains.

            Data and information underpin a vast and increasing amount of both social and economic value. 
            They're key to everything from environmental action to access to medicines to supply chain resilience. 
            While there's a growing interest in the technical side of data (think AI, big data and blockchain ledgers) 
            the social science that makes the data economy work, or not, remains neglected. 
            This means that access to important data is falling vastly short of where it could, and should be, 
            and that digital initiatives from databases to software projects regularly fail because of financial difficulties. 
            This is a waste. It's a waste of time, of money, and of opportunity. And it doesn't have to be this way. 
            Understanding the basics of diginomics and their implications for designing economic models can significantly help.

            These tools explain why data and information goods are fundamentally different from their physical counterparts, 
            and why this means using the same approach to economics for both simply won't work. 
            It'll then walk you through what this means in practice, providing you with a guide to mechanism design 
            which you can use to ensure the economics of your digital initiative actually work, whatever it may be.
