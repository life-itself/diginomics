          The Open Revolution
          <br />
          <small>Rewriting the rules of the information age</small>
        </h1>
        <p>Forget everything you think you know about the digital age. It’s not about privacy, surveillance, AI or blockchain&mdash;it’s about <strong>ownership</strong>. Because, in a digital age, who owns information controls the future.</p>
        <p>
        <p>In this urgent and provocative book, Rufus Pollock shows how today’s "Closed" digital economy is the source of problems ranging from growing inequality, to unaffordable medicines, to the power of a handful of tech monopolies to control how we think and vote. He proposes a solution that charts a path to a more equitable, innovative and profitable future for all.</p>

    <h1>The Open Revolution Book</h1>
    <h3 class="tagline">An open world, a world in which information is openly and freely available to us all</h3>
    <p>Will the digital revolution give us digital dictatorships or digital democracies? Forget everything you think you know about the digital age. It’s not about privacy, surveillance, AI or blockchain&mdash;it's about ownership. Because, in a digital age, who owns information controls the future.</p>
    <p>Today, information is everywhere. From your DNA to the latest blockbusters, from lifesaving drugs to the app on your phone, from big data to algorithms. Our entire global economy is built on it and the rules around information affect us all every day.</p>
    <p>As information continues to move into the digital domain, it can be copied and distributed with ease, making access and control even more important. But the rules we have made for it, derived from how we manage physical property, are hopelessly maladapted to the digital world.</p>
    <p>In this urgent and provocative book, Rufus Pollock shows that we must make a choice between making information Open, shared by all, or making it Closed, exclusively owned and controlled, and how today’s Closed digital economy is the source of problems ranging from growing inequality, to unaffordable medicines, to the power of a handful of tech monopolies to control how we think and vote.</p>
    <p>Choosing Open is the path to a more equitable, innovative and profitable future for all.</p>
