The Open Revolution vision is for a more free, innovative and equitable world. No one wants to see a government committee deciding which authors or music-artists to support or what software should be written, but traditional, demand-driven market mechanisms can be used to allocate all or part of the money collected. Instead of the patent and copyright monopolies they have today, innovators and creators would be granted remuneration rights. These would entitle the owners to payment from a remuneration rights fund, according to the value that the information generates â€“ for example, how much impact a specific medicine has on improving health or how many times a song is played.
