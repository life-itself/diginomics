This depends on the sector and the country / geo-political region. Let’s take pharmaceuticals and the music market in the Netherlands as examples. 

<u>Pharmaceuticals market</u>

There are already substantial sources of funding for medicines in the form of healthcare budgets, divided amongst direct grant and indirect funding through drug purchases. This funding comes from taxpayers, philanthropists, employers and insurers. In an Open world, the funds granted by government and philanthropists and money paid by insurers would be place in the remuneration fund. 

<u>Music sector in the Netherlands </u>

If the music sector was Open every recording ever made anywhere would then be Openly available within the Netherlands, but with an electronic wall to prevent people in other countries accessing them (at least until those countries also became Open). Any Dutch citizen would be at liberty to listen to, share or remix any recording or composition. To pay for this, the government might, for instance, add a small charge to the data plan of everyone’s phone. Unlike Spotify’s fee, this would be very low. How low? Well, let’s examine how much it would take to pay creators as much or more than they receive today. Currently, the total revenue for music in the Netherlands is around €150m a year. Of this, probably less than 60% goes to creators, but let’s err on the generous side and suppose that all of it does. With some 15 million adults in the Netherlands, a fixed fee per adult to pay for all current use of recorded music would be €10 per person per year. At 85¢ a month, this is less than a tenth of Spotify’s €10 a month. If the levy were payable only by people with internet subscriptions, the charge would be around €1.75 a month per connection.
