To implement remuneration rights the simplest, but least plausible, approach is a global “big bang”, with every country worldwide abruptly shifting to this new approach on the same day. Existing monopoly rights such as patents and copyrights would be abolished, new remuneration rights would be available, and the new, open, model would go into operation. The complications, though, are enormous.

Incremental adoption, with individual nations or groups of nations trying out the open approach in full or in part is much more likely to succeed, with the pioneers helping to improve the model, and inspiring the laggards. 

So how to we start to push for this incremental adoption? We propose the following sketch of a strategy for change:

1. Spread the idea  
Remuneration rights are being discussed at a grass-root level and with journalists, bloggers and thought leaders. Check out our Latest News section to see where the Open Revolution is being discussed.

2. Worked solutions  
White papers are being developed to showcase how remuneration rights would work in practice in a number of industries/sectors including: Pharmaceuticals, Music, Artists, novelist and poets, Big Tech, software, AI, Academic journals.

3. Remuneration rights pilots and prototypes  
The negative trends of increasing inequality, concentration of power and the stifling of innovation are only set to continue if the system remains Closed. As the movement for an Open world grows, there will be sectors and/or countries that will pilot remuneration rights as an alternative way to fund innovation.

4. Push for implementation  
In the not-too-distant future, Think Tanks will be conducting impact assessments for rolling out remuneration rights, forward looking governments will incorporate remuneration rights into their manifestos and these ideas will be debated in parliaments. 

In addition, the implementation of remuneration rights does not depend on government as philanthropists and patrons of the arts could pledge their money directly into embryonic remuneration rights pool.

If you being called to be part of the movement that reclaims the original vision of the internet, and ensures that the digital era is open, inclusive and the spirit of innovation continues to thrive, please [join us] (https://openrevolution.net/make-it-happen/)
