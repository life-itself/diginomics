If everyone can use information freely, how do we ensure that people help to pay for its creation? We are all familiar with the free-rider problem, though usually with regard to shared physical resources rather than the informational commons. The key is to ensure the net to capture is as wide and unobtrusively as possible.

If the State were to collect the monies, it would involve a combination of general taxation and levies similar to existing value-added taxes. These levies would be best attached to specific goods or services, usually with a strong informational aspect, for three reasons. First, dedicating a particular levy to the creation of a specific type of information – a broadband and 4G levy going to fund music and movies, for instance – feels instinctively fair and appropriate. Second, open information makes digital devices such as computers and internet services more valuable, because the more information they can access, the more valuable they are. Third, demand for these services and devices is probably quite inelastic (i.e., demand does not vary so much with price), so a (relatively) small tax or levy would be efficient, in that it would be unlikely to distort behaviour and so create deadweight losses (i.e. cost to society created by market inefficiency).

In sum, the levy should be associated with a related good or service - e.g. broadband and 4G levy going to fund music and movies or part of the VAT on electronic goods funding software. Providing the levy was set at the right level, this would have a net positive effect on the market and solve the free-rider problem (domestically) because most people would pay for broadband/4G to stream music or buy hardware to use software.
