# Announce

**The Open Revolution: rewriting the rules of the information age**

Rufus Pollock, the Founder of Open Knowledge, is delighted to announce the launch of his new book on how we can revolutionize information ownership and access in the digital economy.

**About the book**

Forget everything you think you know about the digital age. It's not about privacy, surveillance, AI or blockchain -- it's about **ownership**. In this urgent and provocative new book, Rufus Pollock presents a new diagnosis for the ills of the digital age and charts a path to a more equitable, innovative and profitable future.

Pollock exposes the myths that cloud the digital debate. Looking beneath the surface, into the basic rules of the digital economy, he offers a simple solution. The answer is not technological but political: a choice between making information Open, shared by all, or making it Closed, exclusively owned and controlled. Today in a Closed world we find ourselves at the mercy of digital dictators.  What would a more Open future look like?
