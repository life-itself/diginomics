                <div class="desc">The negative trends of increasing inequality, concentration of power and the stifling of innovation are only set to continue if the system remains Closed. As the movement for an Open world grows, there will be sectors and/or countries that will pilot remuneration rights as an alternative way to fund innovation.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="desc">In the not-too-distant future, Think Tanks will be conducting impact assessments for rolling out remuneration rights, forward looking governments will incorporate remuneration rights into their manifestos and these ideas will be debated in parliaments.
                <br/><br/>
                In addition, the implementation of remuneration rights does not depend on government as philanthropists and patrons of the arts could pledge their money directly into embryonic remuneration rights pool.
