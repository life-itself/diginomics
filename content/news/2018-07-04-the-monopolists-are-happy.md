**Copyright** The digital future of Europe decides behind closed doors this week. The European Parliament will probably continue to strengthen the power of digital monopolies

An inconspicuous vote in the European Parliament will set the course for the digital economy of Europe this Thursday. It marks the temporary climax of a bitter dispute over the digital future of the continent. Parliamentarians will adopt far-reaching rules regulating digital platforms - disguised as bureaucratic subtleties of copyright.

The low level of public attention is related to the non-transparent process under which the decision should be taken. Even a few days before the plenary session, one looks in vain in the official documents for clues to the momentous vote on Thursday. In any case, two weeks ago, the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee decided that Parliament's plenary session should not deal with the individual aspects of the law. Instead, the so-called trilogue procedure is proposed, which brings together representatives of the three European institutions - Commission, Parliament and Council - and draws up compromises to the exclusion of the public. The intention behind the trilogue to shorten lengthy coordination processes is praiseworthy and contributes to to keep the Union politically motivated. However, negotiations behind closed doors are increasingly leading to the public being excluded from the debate.

In the present case, this is momentous: The directive contains an explosive legacy of the former Digital Commissioner Günther Oettinger. Under his leadership, the agency had fed a legal instrument into the document in 2016, which causes outright horror among Internet experts. Platforms like Facebook, Wordpress or Medium.com should be forced to set up so-called "upload filters". These would examine every post and comment of a user to see if the text is similar to an older post so as to prevent its publication. This is to prevent unauthorized distribution of copyrighted texts and images.

A real thought
--------------

Behind it all lies a real idea: Digital platforms like Facebook, Google and Co. generate billions, while journalists whose contributions are shared on the platforms hardly benefit from it. Musicians, filmmakers and photographers also feel cheated by the digital companies for their share of the added value. While the creative industry is dwindling and publishers are increasingly desperate to find financing models, the tech giants celebrate incredible leaps in profits year after year. It makes sense to aim for a redistribution of the digital dividend.

Believing that they are doing something good for creatives, Oettinger and many others seek to leverage the copyright. But this turns out to be a double-edged sword. For copyright, once conceived to strengthen creative creators, has long since become a plaything for the media corporations and their major law firms.

Basically, the monopoly position of Internet giants is based solely on the fiction of "intellectual property". It is copyright and patent rights that protect the functional mechanisms of their platforms from competitors. Economic platforms that bring together different market participants have always had a tendency to monopolize. For this reason, centuries ago, most cities had only one fish market or stock exchange. But in the digital world, it should actually be easier to build competing platforms. While space for a fish market is strictly physical, multiple search engines or social media platforms can coexist with each other.

Only a single fish market
-------------------------

But copyright on algorithms guarantees the top dogs that their competitors can not even take over the basic functionality of a platform. This would correspond to a situation in which, for example, the Hamburg fish market could secure the sole right to sell fish in large halls. There would then be no fishmarket in Bremen, none in Frankfurt and of course no such market in Barcelona. Can we imagine that? But what seems absurd to us in the analogue world has long been reality in the digital economy. So-called "intellectual property" prevents competitors from copying and expanding the functionality of a digital platform - or simply offering an alternative to consumption.

But how can digital monopolies be broken up on the one hand and fair remuneration for musicians, journalists and photographers on the other? The economist Rufus Pollock outlines in his new book *The Open Revolution* an "open economy" on the basis of novel compensation rights. Such "remuneration rights" would appropriately reward creatives while ensuring that access to knowledge and information is free. More competition among the platforms would also bring the creative and cultural workers into a completely different bargaining position. It would be them who dictate to Google and Facebook the terms on which they can use their content.

MEPs could still turn the tables, suspend the intransparent trilogue procedure and bring the debate back to plenary. But it looks like they will instead beckon the proposal of the Legal Affairs Committee unseen on Thursday. If the citizens of Europe are not protesting loudly, the digital monopolies will be happy again in the end.
