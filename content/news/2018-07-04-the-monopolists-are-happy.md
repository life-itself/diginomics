> But how can digital monopolies be broken up on the one hand and fair remuneration for musicians, journalists and photographers on the other? The economist Rufus Pollock outlines in his new book The Open Revolution an "open economy" on the basis of novel compensation rights.

More competition among the platforms would also bring the creative and cultural workers into a completely different bargaining position. It would be them who dictate to Google and Facebook the terms on which they can use their content.
