We are evolving Open Revolution to Diginomics. This evolutions reflect our broadening mission to share tools and insights for the distinct economics of the digital age ("diginomics").

We have a lot of material -- and even more thinking -- which we haven't published anywhere. At the same time, there is a clear need for broader and more practical  content. We are therefore evolving Open Revolution into a new Diginomics site to address this need.

The site will provide a grounding in the economics of digital, information economy as well as toolkits for solving key micro and macro challenges ranging from sustaining data sharing in a specific area (e.g. carbon data across the supply) to economy wide issues like tech monopolies.

## Context: Open Revolution is five years old and much has changed

The openrevolution.net site and book are now five years old ðŸ˜²

The content has been well received but the book tells a high level story. The existing openrevolution.net site focuses on the book: it's currently just "the book website". 

The topics covered by the book continue to become ever more visible and mainstream -- for example, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon etc are now clearly of major concern for the public and regulators.

We have also been regularly approached by people involved in various projects related to data sharing who want insight into the economics and incentives to underpin this. Understanding is often limited and there is a clear need.

Finally, we have lot of other material both published e.g. https://imedproject or unpublished that is relevant, which could be helpful if it was more accessible.

## The Need and Opportunity: there's a broader topic to address and we already have the material

The current framing for the site is naturally about the book. The Open Revolution was focused on the high level vision of an "open world". Whilst valuable this framing is much narrower than what we have to offer: a full guide to building blocks of the digital economy and how to use that knowledge to design effective digital business models and digital economies -- especially for more public digital infrastructure. Moreover, this broader and more neutral framing is likely attractive to a wider audience -- whilst still including our former work.

The last five plus years we have produced a lot of material. This includes material related to the book such as footnotes and detailed open models for particular areas such as medicine and news. And it also importantly includes a variety of broader material about digital economics in general -- including, for example a complete [guide to web3](https://web3.lifeitself.org/guide/). However, much of this material is either unpublished or scattered and hence inaccessible. Even the material on this site could be better organized and presented.

## How can we evolve this project?

We come to the question then of how we can evolve this project? Specifically, what can we do to make our existing work accessible and useful for a larger and broader group of people and challenges?

And does so ...

- Without requiring the use of significant extra resources beyond those we have spare in-house? (we have as yet no additional funding)
- Being as open as possible in what we share so as to enable contribution and reuse

Specific sub-questions for us are:

* What questions and needs do people have? For example:
  * We have come across more and more projects where people realize the need to consider business models and economic sustainability but often lack relevant background or tools?
  * How do we have a great digital information economy?  
  * How can we reduce tech monopoly without harming innovation?
  * How can we sustain this data project, this data commons, this database?
* What material would address that?
* What material do we prioritize to create / publish? i.e. value vs cost to produce?
* What infrastructure/process do we need to put in place to support that creation now and into the future?
* What's missing in the current presentation?
* What additional material do we have?
* What offers / requests do we have?

We welcome feedback on any and all of these questions!

## Thesis: a guide to core principles of the digital economy plus associated toolkits for designing more sustainable digital infrastructure and economies

Our current these is to:

1. **Publish guides to the core principles of the digital economy**: why they are so important, how they differ from old material economy and why that matters.
2. **Publish toolkits for designing sustainable digital business models and economies** the core principles lead naturally into a necessary discussion of business models and incentives around creating and sharing digital, information goods like software and databases. In particular, how you can sustainably fund digital goods, especially "public" ones.

In doing this we will outline the various approaches that you can take and how these models and systems can be applied in different areas. For example, designing the business model for a database tracking green house gas emissions across the supply chain, funding new medicines for cancer, funding basic scientific research, democratising big tech and more. What we provide will be frameworks and toolkits: building blocks and patterns that you can use to design specific solutions rather than a rigid blueprint you copy/paste identically.
