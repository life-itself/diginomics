# Conditional payment models

**Revenue source:** Either pure grants/subsidies or mixed with user fees and perhaps complementary goods services

**Compensation mechanism:** Conditional payment

**Governance model:** Any, preferably multi-stakeholder

**Rights framework**: Open or Semi-open 

Conditional payment models can take a number of forms. Their determining feature is that rather than offering fixed financial payments to contributors these payments are conditional on some set of criteria, usually to do with outcomes. 

The two most common types are **_prizes_** and **_remuneration rights_**. 
* Prizes function by offering a set payment for anyone who meets a certain condition. Theyâ€™re often used in medical innovation as a way to incentivise the development of new drugs. 
* Remuneration rights entitle contributors to a proportional share of some central funding pool based on some value metric. This can be anything from relative demand for each individual contribution to an expert assessment of relative importance.

Conditional payment models can in-theory function with any governance model, however the combination of their more distributed structure and the need for value-based allocations to be considered fair, a multi-stakeholder model is recommended. Open access is a condition of payment allocation.
