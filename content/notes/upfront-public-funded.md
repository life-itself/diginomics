# Upfront public funded

**Revenue source:** Grants/subsidies

**Compensation mechanism:** Fixed payment

**Governance model:** Typically consultative

**Rights framework**: Open

This is the “traditional” solution to private sector underprovision or lack of access. Public bodies such as governments and IGOs commission the production of digital goods through grants or subsidies, or produce them in-house (essentially “internally” grant funding them). Governance is typically consultative given these bodies themselves have diverse stakeholders, and may be working with other producers who they are funding. However, final decision making authority typically rests with the funding authority. Open access is typically a condition of funding[^1].

## Notes

[^1]:
     We are aware that in some contexts e.g. pharmaceutical development grant funding is offered without insistence on open access, We exclude such models here as they are simply the worst of both worlds and not desirable for consideration.
