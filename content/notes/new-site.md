You might have noticed that the open revolution website has evolved. We realized that we had a lot of material (and even more thinking) which we hadn’t published anywhere, and that there was a clear need for more generalized and practically focused content. We created the new diginomics site to address this need. The site provides grounding in the economics of digital (information) economy and toolkits of concepts and templates for solving key micro and macro challenges e.g. sustaining data sharing in X area (e.g. carbon data) or addressing tech monopolies.

This blog lays out our thinking behind the evolution in the SCQA format.


# Situation
The openrevolution.net site and book have existed for some time. The content has been well received but the book tells a high level story. The existing openrevolution.net site focuses on the book; it’s currently just “the book website”. 

The topics covered by the book continue to become ever more visible and mainstream (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon etc are now clearly semi “bad guys”). We are getting approached by people involved in various projects related to data sharing who want insight into the economics and incentives to underpin this; understanding is limited and there is a need.

We have other material both published (e.g. imedproject) or unpublished that is relevant, which could be helpful if it was more accessible to people.


# Complication
The current framing for the Open Revolution is off and off-putting: the framing is about an open world rather than a framing of “here’s the key building blocks of the digital economy”. The latter would be broader and less zealous whilst being able to include the former. A broader and more “neutral” framing of diginomics will be more useful.

Current material is also so-so could be easily improved:


* We have detailed answers (and even material) for the above and it isn’t on the site (e.g. book not footnoted, detailed models for particular areas).
* Material on the site isn’t immediately accessible or useful in many applied contexts.
* The book offers a general solution rather than specific examples of how the ideas could work in different scenarios.


# Question
What do we build which incorporates our existing work and thinking in a way which makes it accessible and useful for diverse people and challenges, and which does not require the use of significant extra resources beyond those we have spare in-house?


## Sub-questions:
* What questions / needs do people have? (We are coming across more and more projects where people realize thinking about incentives and economic sustainability of data matters but huge chasm of thought/understanding)
* What material would address that?
* What material do we prioritize to create / publish (need vs cost to produce?)
* What infrastructure/process do we need to put in place to support that creation now and into the future)?
* What’s missing in the current presentation?
* What additional material do we have?
* What offers / requests do we have?


## Potential user questions: 
* How do we have a great information economy?  
* How can we overcome monopoly without killing innovation? 
* How can we sustain this data project, this data commons, this database?


# Answer
Build a core resource outlining the core tenets of the data economy, why they are so important, how they differ from material economy and why that matters.

This leads us into a necessary discussion of business models and incentives around creating and sharing digital, information goods like software and databases.

We outline the different approaches you can take. Why remuneration rights stand above those other alternatives. How these structures and systems can be applied in different areas (e.g. across a specific supply chain, for medicines, for science etc) – it’s a framework and building blocks that you can use (not a fixed blueprint you copy/paste identically). How do you go about this concretely? 

A toolkit for: so you want to do incentives and sustain X resource.
