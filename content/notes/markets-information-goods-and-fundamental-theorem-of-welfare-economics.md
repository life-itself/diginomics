# Why classic markets struggle to produce, allocate and distribute information goods

## Markets, Information Goods and the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics 

A technical explanation of why pure "classical" markets will struggle to produce, allocate or distribute information goods like software and data.

Fundamental theorem of welfare economics requires:

1. Non-convex production functions - no fixed costs and stable or increasing marginal costs 
2. Complete information and markets (including about the future)
3. Everyone is a price taker (no monopoly)

How do information goods compare?

1. All fixed costs, no marginal costs ⟹ complete violation of condition 1
2. Many goods are experience goods, future hugely uncertain and unknown (who imagined the iPhone in 1900 and when it would happen)
3. Monopoly rights ⟹ monopoly ⟹ not a price taker. If we go for market competition then we have problem funding the good (prices go to zero implies zero revenue for creator)

At simplest level "market" is synonymous with competition. But the very essence of monopoly rights is to eliminate traditional competition - only one person has the right to supply the cancer drug or harry potter. the competition we do get is "monopolistic competition" between different goods not between instances of the good.
