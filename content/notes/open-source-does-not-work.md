title: Open Source Does Not Work (mostly)
---

Classic open source model is usually some version of complementary goods model where you try and sell services of SaaS or some add-ons. And that model does not work very well: the complementary goods don't generate enough money needed for investment in the core product. Put crudely: it is as if you gave away fries for free and tried just to make money on the ketchup.

Discussed at length in [[../index|Open Revolution]] under "Fries and Ketchup".
