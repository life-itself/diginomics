title: A Cloud Future? Is the current trend to cloud unstoppable or is it about to reverse?

The move to the cloud is driven largely by continuing improvements in network reliability, bandwidth and latency -- which provide a good user experience when connecting over the network -- and the economies of scale in hosting and deployment. Whether these trends will continue is an open question. In particular, it is unclear whether the current increase in the coupling of software and service will continue.

For example, improvements in network performance and reliability may actually favour moving processing *back* towards individual nodes and allowing them to communicate in a peer to peer manner (rather than centralization that we currently have).

Even with centralization, one could have centralization at the infrastructure level (e.g. in massive server farms) but without tying the software to that infrastructure.

At present, economies of scale arise both from pure scale and from economies in deployment and customization -- making software "cloud ready" (horizontally scalable) is costly. 

However, as we move forward, large scale deployment will become standardized. As that happens, a separation between software and service (infrastructure) may re-establish itself. For example, as architecture and deployment processes get standardized, it will become increasingly easy to deploy any type of software at scale. This will reduce, perhaps even eliminate, the current tie-up between software and service.
