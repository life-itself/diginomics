[[notes/tax-on-big-tech|Tax on big tech]] as a fix for [[fake news]] by Paul Romer in NY Times:

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/opinion/tax-facebook-google.html

> It is the job of government to prevent a tragedy of the commons. That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends. The dominant digital platform companies, including Facebook and Google, make their profits using business models that erode this commons. They have created a haven for dangerous misinformation and hate speech that has undermined trust in democratic institutions. And it is troubling when so much information is controlled by so few companies.
>
> What is the best way to protect and restore this public commons? Most of the proposals to change platform companies rely on either antitrust law or regulatory action. I propose a different solution. Instead of banning the current business model — in which platform companies harvest user information to sell targeted digital ads — new legislation could establish a tax that would encourage platform companies to shift toward a healthier, more traditional model.

Great to see some discussion of taxing or regulating big tech.

At same time, feel this is a [[misdiagnosis]] -- and a misguided solution (therefore). See e.g. [# Solving the Internet Monopolies Problem - Facebook, Google et al](https://rufuspollock.com/2018/02/24/solving-the-internet-monopolies-problem-google-facebook-etc/) and https://rufuspollock.com/2016/11/26/fake-news-post-truth-is-it-news-and-what-can-we-do/.

It shows how significant this issue of misdiagnosis is given that Paul Romer is a brilliant economist and winner of the Nobel Prize.

Other commens:

- Commons discussed is the "commons" of public discourse and norms: "It is the job of government to prevent a tragedy of the commons. That includes the commons of shared values and norms on which democracy depends."
