# Concept Definitions

Business models are composed of **building blocks** which can be assembled under **constraints** to make a **limited number of business model types**. Learning these types–and the list of blocks and the rules for assembly–allow you to rapidly design business models that are successful for chosen outcomes.

Before outlining options for business model types, we must define and outline terminology. 

**Digital goods** are all those economic goods which are made up of data or information. These can range from software to datasets to music and even pieces of intellectual property such as pharmaceutical patents. These goods can also be known as information goods, information products and similar terms. 

The **business model** is the part of the entity or project which incentivises the production and distribution of digital goods. When it functions properly it is economically sustainable, that is to say that these incentives (and this production/distribution) persist over time.

**Building blocks** refer to the different components a business model needs to function. The core building blocks are as follows:



* **Revenue model**: how you earn revenue
* **Legal structure**: how the entity is organized and incorporated
* **Supplier remuneration mechanism**: how suppliers are incentivised to contribute 

There are a number of different options for each building block. There are **constraints** on how different building block options can be combined. This limits the number of combinations which are possible, as choices around one building block can limit others. 


The upshot of these constraints is that there are a limited number of **business model types** which can be created. Types are just generalized combinations of building blocks, and form the basis of any specific business model which is then created in reality. By analogy “seeded wholemeal” is a generalized type of bread, although each major supermarket may create their own real world instantiation of this type.

Different model types will have different **features**. These are specific characteristics of how the business model functions. The major features we will consider are:



* **Level of access**: how widely accessible the business model makes data
* **Profitability**: the money the business model generates after costs
* **Quality**: the quality is the data produced under the business model 

Different model types can vary across these dimensions. Choosing a model type will in part depend on how these features are weighted against each other.


# Outlining Building Blocks

The diagram below shows the different options available for each building block. We will describe these below. Note that these options are categories and each one can be varied and tweaked in a variety of ways. Our aim here is to give a broad outline and distinguish the main categories from which one begins to assemble a business model. Think of it like a car: you choose the make and model and the broad features and then at the end you choose details like the specific color or trim or whether it has a sunroof or not.

## Revenue model

This building block determines how the business model earns the revenue to support it. There are four broad options here, while they can be mixed together:

* **Grants/Subsidies**: revenue comes exclusively from grants or subsidies, usually from public bodies or philanthropists but also possible other sources such as sector associations. These can be **_conditional or unconditional._**
    * **_Conditional_**: Prizes and other mechanisms, which pay on the basis of a certain result being achieved e.g. a new vaccine of a certain type
    * **_Unconditional_**: Simply given upfront with no strings attached (beyond perhaps delivering some output). Examples include “unrestricted funding” in the philanthropy sector, or things like open ended research/PhD funding. 
* **User fees**: revenue comes exclusively from fees charged to users in exchange for access.
* **Complementary goods/services**: while the core goods are provided for free, revenue is made from selling other goods and services which people may want alongside the free one. These can be of two types:
    * **_Direct_**: firms will sell goods/services directly to the users of their free product e.g. giving away free razor blades and selling razors, or creating an open source database with a paid SaaS/API offering.
    * **_Indirect_**: firms can sell things like advertising opportunities on their free product, which become more desirable to buy the more free users there are. Google and Facebook are obvious examples.
* **No revenue**: this is rarely seen, but some Open Source projects will have no revenue model at all.


## Legal structure

The legal structure is the incorporated form of the entity. There are three broad options here:



* **For-profit**: a structure focused on generating profits for private owners.
* **Non-profit**: a structure focused on maximizing social value, usually via widespread access.
* **Cooperative**: a structure that is jointly owned and governed by multiple stakeholders, either to share profits or jointly steward its social purpose.

_Note that the cooperative structure can be either a for-profit or non-profit, however we felt it was distinctive enough to include as its own separate category._


## Supplier remuneration mechanism 

The supplier remuneration mechanism dictates how contributors are compensated for their work. This is required to incentivise data providers and other actors who carry out activities necessary for the entity or project to function. There are two initial categories with a number of subcategories under each. Again, mixes of many of these are possible.


* **Paid**: suppliers are paid money to contribute
    * **_Fixed fee_**: traditional payment models where money is exchanged for work or goods.
        * **_Time based_**: payment for time, unconditional on outcome e.g. classic wages.
        * **_Output based_**: pay for specific outputs e.g. piecework or purchasing inputs on the marketplace.
    * **_Surplus rights_**: suppliers aren’t paid a fee, but instead obtain rights to the surplus generated by the business model.
        * **_Equity_**: suppliers receive equity in the entity. This arrangement is common in startups and businesses offering stock options.
        * **_Remuneration rights_**: suppliers obtain a right to a share of the surplus that is conditional to some metric of the value they have contributed. This might be the demand for their contribution relative to others (e.g. downloads of their dataset in the database / total downloads of all datasets) or another form of value proxy.
* **Unpaid**: suppliers are not paid any money.
    * **_Compulsory_**: suppliers have to contribute due to regulation or other mandates.
    * **_Ethics/reputation_**: suppliers contribute due to their value commitments, or because they obtain reputational benefits from doing so freely.
    * **_Complementary goods/services_**: suppliers contribute for free in order to then sell other goods/services which are complementary to the one they contribute to.


# Constraints

There are a number of constraints on how you combine model building blocks. We will explore these in detail in later work, but for now the two most obvious ones are as follows:



* You cannot have a paid supplier remuneration model without some form of revenue model. This model also needs to generate sufficient revenue to pay enough suppliers at the requisite level. 
* You cannot have a fully Open access business model and have user fees of any kind.


# Outcomes

Business models will be designed to optimize for different outcomes. Broadly the are two types of outcome that a business model can target:



* **Increasing social welfare**
* **Making money**

Now of course many projects or entities will seek both to some degree, however the degree to which they are balanced against one another can vary. The degree to which a business model can achieve these outcomes depends on its features: 



* **Access**: optimizing for social welfare will mean selecting a business model which prioritizes high levels of access. By contrast, business models which use closed rights frameworks may enable the organization to make more money (although this is not always the case, as businesses such as Facebook demonstrate). 
* **Quality**: optimizing for social welfare will mean setting the level of data quality at the most useful level affordable, all things being equal. By contrast, a business model seeking to make the most money possible will produce the digital goods at whatever quality maximizes profit. Often, this will be the lowest quality possible without detrimentally impacting demand. This said, most business models that generate little revenue will obviously struggle to maintain quality. By and large quality costs money, usually in the form of paying professional suppliers and staff.
* **Profitability**: different models will be differently profitable. Crucially, profitability can often seem to come into conflict with access. Optimizing for money making via profit may mean the use of fees and other mechanisms which reduce access and thus social welfare. On the flip side, the most obvious route to high access and thus social welfare–free universal public provision–is innately unprofitable by definition. This can create a revenue model which is unsustainable, and provision which is vulnerable to shifts in the priorities and budgets of public bodies.
