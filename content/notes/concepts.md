# Concept Definitions

Business models are composed of **building blocks** which can be assembled under **constraints** to make a **limited number of business model types**. Learning these types–and the list of blocks and the rules for assembly–allow you to rapidly design business models that are successful for chosen outcomes.

Before outlining options for business model types, we must define and outline terminology. 

**Digital goods** are all those economic goods which are made up of data or information. These can range from software to datasets to music and even pieces of intellectual property such as pharmaceutical patents. These goods can also be known as information goods, information products and similar terms. 

The **business model** is the part of the entity or project which incentivises the production and distribution of digital goods. When it functions properly it is economically sustainable, that is to say that these incentives (and this production/distribution) persist over time.

**Building blocks** refer to the different components a business model needs to function. The core building blocks are as follows:



* **Revenue source** - where money comes from
* **Compensation mechanism** - how contributors are compensated for their work
* **Governance model**- how decisions are made
* **Rights framework** - how rights for access and use are defined 

There are a number of different options for each building block. There are **constraints** on how different building block options can be combined. This limits the number of combinations which are possible, as choices around one building block can limit others. For example, not every revenue source is compatible with every rights framework. We will elaborate more on constraints below.

The upshot of these constraints is that there are a limited number of **business model types** which can be created. Types are just generalized combinations of building blocks, and form the basis of any specific business model which is then created in reality. By analogy “seeded wholemeal” is a generalized type of bread, although each major supermarket may create their own real world instantiation of this type.

Different model types will have different **features.** These are specific characteristics of how the business model functions. The major features we will consider are:


* **Level of access** - how widely accessible the business model makes data
* **Profitability**- the money the business model generates after costs
* **Quality**- the quality is the data produced under the business model 

Different model types can vary across these dimensions. Choosing a model type will in part depend on how these features are weighted against each other.


# Outlining Building Blocks

The diagram below shows the different options available for each building block. We will describe these below. Note that even these options are themselves broad umbrellas and can themselves branch into further variations when developed further.

![Building Blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72795023/228253252-e484ba31-6e70-4953-90f7-455feef736d0.svg)


## Revenue Source

This building block determines where the money comes from. There are four broad options here:



* **Grants/Subsidies** - revenue comes exclusively from grants or subsidies, usually from public bodies or philanthropists but also possible other sources such as sector associations .
* **User fees** - revenue comes exclusively from fees charged to users in exchange for access.
* **Mixed** - revenue comes from a mixture of grants/subsidies and fees. For example, core costs may be covered by grants, while fees are used to cover additional activities. 
* **None/Donations** - this option is only used by “pure” open source projects, which do not have an explicit revenue source and rely only on voluntary individual donations. Wikipedia is such an example.


## Compensation Mechanism 

The compensation mechanism dictates how contributors are compensated for their work. This is required to incentivise data providers and other actors who carry out activities necessary for the entity or project to function. The options are:



* **Salary** - all activities are undertaken in-house, by employees who are compensated through their salaries.
* **Fixed Fee** - goods and services are purchased from third parties at a price which is set according to what is being purchased. For example: 100 EUR per dataset. 
* **Conditional Payment** - rather than a fixed fee, third parties are given a conditional payment right entitling them to a share of profits. Entitlement can be based on many factors, including demand or some metric of importance. For example: share of profit share = number of times your dataset downloaded / total downloads for all datasets. 
* **Complementary Goods/Services** - contributors are not paid directly in money, but are compensated through an ability to sell complementary goods or services. For example: data providers share data for free, and then sell consultancy services based on expert use of this data. 
* **Pro Bono** - contributors get no compensation at all. They contribute for other reasons such as their values or positive reputational benefits.
* **Mixed** - compensation is made up of a combination of the above.


## Governance Model

The governance model refers to how decisions are made about how the entity or project functions. Governance is so closely linked to business model functioning that we have included it as a building block of the business model in its own right. The options are:



* **Unilateral** - one entity makes all decisions about how the entity or project functions, for example the European Commission.
* **Consultative** - decision making power is still concentrated in the hands of a single body, however other actors can input into decisions via non-binding advisory mechanisms. An example might be an advisory panel of specialists. 
* **Multi-stakeholder** - the governing body itself is composed of representatives of multiple key stakeholders. For example a governing board with members from governments and IGOs, the private sector and civil society representing data providers, users and policymakers. 


## Rights Framework

The rights framework determines the rights of access and use granted to users, and on what terms. The options are:



* **Open** - following the Open Definition, the data “can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose”.
* **Semi-open**  - shorthand for a dual license model, where the data can be used, modified and shared freely for non-commercial purposes and commercial purposes require payment of a fee.
* **Closed** - the data is fully guarded by a paywall or other protection mechanism. All users must pay a fee or meet some other criteria for access and use. Sharing the data with those ineligible for access is prohibited (although the license may allow for the data to be used to create novel products which _can_ then be shared).


# Constraints

There are some basic constraints on how the building blocks can be combined. There are two types of constraint:



* **Hard** - the building blocks are fundamentally incompatible with one another; a model trying to combine them will fail by definition.
* **Soft**- the building blocks can technically be combined, but it is difficult or inadvisable to do so.

We will deal with each in turn.


## Hard Constraints

There is only one genuine hard constraint on combining building blocks. This is that **an Open access rights framework is incompatible with any revenue model relying on user fees, either partially or entirely.** Definitionally, if anyone has to pay to access data, then that data is not Open. 


## Soft Constraints 

There are far more soft constraints, however. These are as follows:



* Grants/subsidies are an infeasible revenue source for an entity or project with a fully closed rights framework. 
    * **Reason**: Highly limited access conditions will likely make the project unattractive to potential funders under most conditions.
* None/donations is an infeasible revenue source for an entity or project with a fully closed rights framework.
    * **Reason**: a closed entity or project will by definition have fewer potential users, limiting the level of donations which can be gathered. Also, if the entity or project is relying largely or entirely on pro bono contributions or complementary goods/services models then in the former case there are limited reasons why someone would contribute to a closed entity or project for free (given ethics based contributions often seek to advance open knowledge) and in the latter case the market for complementary goods/services will probably be smaller for a closed entity or project than an open or semi-open one.
* None/donations is an infeasible revenue source for an entity or project which predominantly uses salaries, fees or conditional payments as a compensation mechanism.
    * **Reason**: it will be hard to gather enough donations to make sufficient monetary payments of these kinds.
* As a rule of thumb, the less guaranteed compensation offered under the compensation mechanism (moving to the right on the diagram, excluding mixed models) the more democratic one should make the governance model (moving to the right on the diagram).
    * **Reason**: participation in governance can act as an added incentive to contributors in the place of money. Also, where compensation depends on the success of the entity or project as in the conditional payment and (to a lesser extent) complementary goods/services compensation mechanisms, contributors will likely want to be able to influence this outcome.


# Outcomes

Business models will be designed to optimize for different outcomes. Broadly the are two types of outcome that a business model can target:



* **Increasing social welfare **
* **Making money**

Now of course many projects or entities will seek both to some degree, however the degree to which they are balanced against one another can vary. The degree to which a business model can achieve these outcomes depends on its features: 



* **Access**: optimizing for social welfare will mean selecting a business model which prioritizes high levels of access. By contrast, business models which use closed rights frameworks may enable you to make more money (although this is not always the case, as businesses such as Facebook demonstrate). 
* **Quality:** optimizing for social welfare will mean setting the level of data quality at the most useful level affordable, all things being equal. This is a matter of cost-benefit analysis, trading off gains in quality most often against levels of provision (i.e. the same resources can get you more lower quality digital goods or fewer higher quality digital goods) By contrast, a business model seeking to make the most money possible will produce the digital goods at whatever quality maximizes profit. Often, this will be the lowest quality possible without detrimentally impacting demand.
