# Conditional revenue sharing models

**Revenue source:** Either pure grants/subsidies or mixed with user fees and perhaps complementary goods and services

**Compensation mechanism:** Conditional revenue sharing

**Legal structure:** Any

Rather than offering fixed financial payments to suppliers, conditional revenue sharing models allocate them a right to a _variable_ share of the (after cost) revenue pool. The revenue share a given supplier is entitled to is conditional on some set of criteria, usually to do with outcomes. Often outcomes are measured via a metric or metrics designed to act as a proxy for value generated by that supplier's contribution. This can be anything from relative demand for each individual contribution to an expert assessment of it's importance, relative to all other contributions.

These models differ from classic equity based models in that revenue share is determined by a value metric rather than just the amount of shares owned. They are thus compatible with legal structures where suppliers in fact do not have any ownership at all. In theory, a conditional revenue sharing model could be adopted under a cooperative legal structure, where the co-owners all agreed to distribute revenue in this manner rather than on the basis of their ownership shares.
