# Private monopoly

**Revenue source:** Fees

**Compensation mechanism:** Fixed payments

**Governance model:** Typically unilateral 

**Rights framework**: Closed, sometimes semi-open

This model type is what dominates most private sector production of digital goods. Private firms charge fees to access digital goods in order to make a profit. This is often a set subscription price but can also be a charge for a copy of the digital good itself (e.g. a standalone piece of software). These firms make unilateral decisions about their production, guided by the profit-maximizing incentive. Usually all provision is subject to payment, but sometimes free access is granted in exceptional cases e.g. to nonprofits.
