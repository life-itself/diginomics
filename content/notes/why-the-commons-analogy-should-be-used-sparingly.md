title: Why the Commons analogy should be used sparingly

The Commons analogy should be used sparingly for information because the information commons is fundamentally different from a classic physical commons.

A physical commons is rival in use and the basic problem is over-exploitation.

An information commons is [[../nonrival|nonrival]] and the basic problem is under-contribution.

What they have in common in non-excludability and hence a a [[collective-action-problem|collective action problem]].

Their differences are crucial to what this implies.

For a rival physical commons like a fishery or a swimming pool, increasing excludability (if costless) should be a "good thing".

However, for a nonrival good, excludability is ambiguous: it may increase production -- more patents may mean more drugs -- but it hurts supply -- more patents means more costly drugs. Exclusion here means literally excludes some people from access to a treatment harming their health and their society.
