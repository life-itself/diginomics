> On Twitter, [Robin Hanson asked a question yesterday](https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/598843908144128001) I have given a lot of thought to, which is why the bigger venture capital firms dominate the market and make oversize profits while the other firms taken together make almost no profits. Most industries do not work that way, so this requires explanation. ... [https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2015/05/15/in-a-world-of-venture-capital/]

One strong potential answer is that this is very similar to private equity. Like private equity, VC is largely about deal flow i.e. getting access to (lots of) good opportunities - not only b/c you get to pick good deals but you get a better sense of market (i.e. private information). You also have a better chance to raise capital etc in the first place and offer other things to investees.

Form an abstract "model" perspective I'd say this is classic platform markets ([[platformnomics]]) + some learning by doing effects. The first has massive tendencies to concentration in the market and the second has some.

If you are interested in market concentration i recommend this masterpiece [https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sunk-costs-and-market-structure](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sunk-costs-and-market-structure) which has both rich modelling and lots of data. Note Sutton doesn't have anything on platforms which, if anything, lead to even greater concentration. If you wonder what we are going to do about this level of concentration - given that fixed/sunk costs and platforms are ubiquitous in an information economy - check out the Open Revolution [https://openrevolution.net/](https://openrevolution.net/)
