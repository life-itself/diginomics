Having outlined the different archetypal models in our [prior blog](/summary-past-work.md), it’s time to compare them. The table below shows the comparisons we undertook during an internal brainstorming session, showing how the models stack up against one another across a variety of metrics:

Another way of thinking about this is via decisions. Deciding on what you do or don’t want with respect to a certain feature will inevitably lead you towards certain models over others. To illustrate, here’s a decision tree we put together around financing and payment:

Now of course, payment isn't the only thing we care about. There are other important considerations such as:
* Feasibility (lack of feasibility is why we've already greyed out mandating and commons based peer production models, for example)
* The amount of money to creators and thus the amount created
* Acccess to the results
* Ease of coordinating contributions

Specific contexts will likely also carry their own important factors beyond these. Model selection is about weighing these against one another, and making a decision based on prioritisation. 
A future blog will offer a more detailed breakdown of how these models compare across key metrics, but in the meantime our [report on mechanism design for environmental data sharing](https://labs.lifeitself.org/writing/incentives) also outlines some of the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
