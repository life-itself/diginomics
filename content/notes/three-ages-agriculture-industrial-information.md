We talk about the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution. And now we have the information revolution. The agricultural revolution happened approx 8,000 years ago. the industrial approx 250 years ago. The information revolution is happening now.[^1]

### Agriculture age

Productivity change in food production. Productivity growth limited and after the initial burst slow (if any). No economies of scale (much).

Led to: population growth (vs gatherer-hunters) and to stationary agricultural surplus which meant cities, states, rent extraction and social stratification.

### Industrial age

Specialization, economies of scale, capital (machines). Sustained productivity growth across all sectors. Focused on the physical. Making "things".

Led to: population explosion, urbanization, consumerism, scale, technological acceleration, nation-states, democratization.

### Information age

"Infinite" economies of scale (all fixed costs), self-producing (machines produce machines, information produces information). Focused on the non-material (information), non-rival.

Led to: networks, research, globalization, ...

[^1]: the ranges on all of these is significant. The agricultural revolution was a process cumulating over thousands of years. Meanwhile, the industrial revolution is classically dated say 1750-1850 and had its roots in the high middle ages and the renaissance (if not the Greeks and Romans). The information revolution likewise has old roots and would likely (for future historians) have a start date around c. 1945 (first digital computers etc, memex memo etc).
