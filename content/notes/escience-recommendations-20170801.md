Recommendations made 2007-08-01 in response to EU e-science consultation.

In summary:

1. Ensure that repositories are OPEN (see http://www.opendefinition.org/)
2. Build good registries of available material (see e.g. http://www.ckan.net/)
3. Fund and develop open source tools to assist in this process. Aim for minimalist systems which can be adapted and reused by others.
4. Mandate that all work funded via EU monies is made open (that is all research papers should be in open access publications and all associated materials should be open and made available)

## Key Questions

### 10.1 Would establishing national data repositories be a good idea? (optional)

I do not think this needs to be mandated.

A. just make sure infrastructure (e.g. open source software to run repositories efficiently) is there and let people decide.

B. Mandate *researchers* deposit in an open repository.

### 11.1 What would be your vision for digital repositories in the future? (optional)

See responses to previous questions but to reiterate:

1. All government supported (i.e. EU and national)  e-science repositories are open (that is material in them is made available in accordance with the Open Knowledge / Open Data definition http://www.opendefinition.org/)
2. All researchers deposit their material in such repositories.
3. Less 'One Ring to Rule Them All' approach to developing repositories and more of the 'Small Pieces Loosely Joined' one. Focus on developing low level tools (repository software, providing funding basic infrastructure (bandwidth, servers etc), and developing simple interoperability standards for exchanging metadata.
4. Support develop of an open search engine service (this goes much wider than e-science).

C. Barriers to use

Question group 4: Difficulties and barriers to use of digital repositories?

4.1 What do you think are main difficulties when using repositories? Please tick all that apply. 

Too costly
I do not know where to look for a suitable repository
Time consuming to deposit data

4.1.1 If you ticked “Other”, please specify:
 
4.2 Which of the following do you think would indicate that a high level of trust can be placed on a repository and its contents? Tick all that apply.  Peer reviewed contents

4.2.1 If you ticked “Other”, please specify:
 
Question group 5. What would (or does) prevent you from placing your information in a digital repository

5.1 What would (or does) prevent you from depositing your material into a digital repository? (300 characters max.)
Intellectual property rights issues. 

5.2 What would (or does) prevent you from using information from a digital repository? (300 characters max.)
Difficulty of obtaining access and intellectual property rights issues. 

5.3 Have you encountered any specific frustrations using digital repositories? Please describe briefly:
 
D. Adequacy of current provision

Question group 6. Exploring adequacy of provision

6.1 Are you required to deposit your data in a repository?  Not applicable
6.1.1 If yes, is the repository specified?  
6.1.2 If yes, what kind of repository is specified? An open source digital library
A repository established to serve my subject/community
6.2 Do you have access to any help or resources to deposit the materials? 
6.2.1 Please provide further details if you wish:
 
Question group 7. Question on what institutional setting is preferred

7.1 In what kind of digital repository would you feel most comfortable placing/accessing information? Tick all that apply.  An open source digital library

7.1.1 Is there any reason for your preference?

The progress of human knowledge advances most rapidly when information is open, that is free for people to use, reuse and redistribute (see http://www.opendefinition.org/ for more details). 

E. Enablers and Policy Directions

Question group 8. Exploring what advances would increase use and effectiveness/influence of repositories

8.1 What tools, resources, or organisational changes would make digital repositories easier to use? Tick all that apply.  Faster networks

Registries of available repositories(e.g. on-line lists with descriptive information about specific repository resources).

Tools to automatically provide descriptive information (metadata).

8.1.1 If you ticked “Other”, please specify:
 
Question group 9. Exploring where investments would best be made over the next 5-10 years?

9.1 What steps at European level would add value to science, through use of repositories and their materials?

> 1. Ensure that repositories are OPEN (see http://www.opendefinition.org/) 2. Build good registries of available material (see e.g. http://www.ckan.net/) 3. Fund and develop open source tools to assist in this process. Aim for minimalist systems which can be adapted and reused by others. 4. Mandate that all work funded via EU monies is made open (that is all research papers should be in open access publications and all associated materials should be open and made available) 

9.1.1 Please add any other comments relevant to this issue you would like to make:
 
F. Vision for the Future

Question group 10. Further work to be done

10.1 Would establishing national data repositories be a good idea?  Yes

10.1.1 Please add any supporting comments you would like to make:

To be honest I do not think this needs to be mandated. A. just make sure infrastructure (e.g. open source software to run repositories efficiently) is there and let people decide. B. Mandate *researchers* deposit in an open repository. 

10.2 Would establishing international (e.g. EU) data repositories be a good idea? Yes

10.2.1 Please add any supporting comments you would like to make:

See comments on previous question. 
10.3 Do you ever, or would you like to, use any old digital materials?  Older than 20 years

10.4 Do you generate material that needs to be kept for more than 10 years? Don't know

10.4.1 If Yes, where will they be held  Don’t know

10.5 Please add any another other comments you may have on sustainability of digital materials and the role of digital repositories?

How do we know what materials will be useful in 5, 10 or 20 years. Cost of storage is dropping like a stone. If necessary prune a bit, compress and store. 

Question group 11. Opinions on a vision for the future?

11.1 What would be your vision for digital repositories in the future?
