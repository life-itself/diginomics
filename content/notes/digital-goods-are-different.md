# Why digital goods are different

**Digital goods are fundamentally different to physical ones.** This means that the economics of production and distribution when it comes to digital goods are fundamentally more complex and problematic than physical goods, in a number of key ways:

Once a digital good has been produced, it can be **endlessly copied at no extra cost**. Digital goods are **_nonrival_**[^1]. This has two implications:

1) The **marginal costs of production[^2] of digital goods is essentially zero**. This causes one of the fundamental “laws” of neoclassical economics, that efficient, profit-maximizing firms will produce at the quantity where the marginal costs of production = marginal revenue, to break down entirely. Price and production levels of digital goods are inherently more complex.

2) Without interventions if a customer buys a single digital good, for example a copy of a piece of software or a dataset, then they can endlessly copy it and distribute it to everyone they know for free. This presents obvious problems for turning a profit from the sale of digital goods. If I can’t gain adequate income from selling my goods, then my incentives to create them in the first place are significantly undermined.

It’s not just customers who can copy infinitely, though. **firms that own the rights to produce a digital good hold the capability to monopolize production**. They can create endless copies of a good for almost nothing and no-one else is allowed to compete. Consider the famous antitrust case against Microsoft.

There are also a number of other features of digital goods which are worth noting.

While marginal costs of production are close to zero, **digital goods can have significant fixed costs of production**. Goods such as pieces of software often require significant research and development spending to produce a working final product. Similarly, creating aggregated and integrated datasets from diverse pieces of data can be a painstaking process.  

Aggregation also means that **digital goods often have hyper complex value-chains**. In many cases it’s only at the aggregation stage that significant value is created. For example compiling thousands if not millions of pieces of climate emissions data into a single dataset is what generates value for end users seeking insights into their emissions. Not only this, but each piece of data can have a different supplier, who also needs a reason to supply their part of the final dataset.

Incentives (at least according to orthodox economics) are a matter of cost-benefit analysis. At the most basic level rational agents will do something such as produce a good if there is a net benefit to doing so i.e. the benefits outweigh the costs (including opportunity costs[^3]). If the net benefits to wider society of producing a good outweigh the net benefit to private producers, we get market failure - the good will be underproduced versus the socially optimal level. 

**The unique traits of digital goods listed above mean they’re particularly susceptible to market failures**. People can’t produce digital goods and sell them in the same way as other goods, and so Adam Smith’s parable of the baker breaks down. Even in cases of private benefit, these can be subtle and not apparent to key decision-makers (e.g. efficiency gains in ways that aren't apparent upfront), meaning there’s still a disinclination to invest. They might also take the form of industry wide benefits (e.g. from innovation potential), which are hindered by the dynamics of collective action problems[^4].

     This means that one person using the good doesn’t reduce it for others. If I eat the bread you can’t also eat it, but if I use a piece of data you can use it also.

     The cost of producing one extra unit of a good.

     Opportunity costs are the other options for spending your time and resources passed up.
