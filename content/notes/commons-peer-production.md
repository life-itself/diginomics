**Revenue source:** None/donation

**Compensation mechanism:** Pro bono

**Governance model:** Multi-stakeholder

**Rights framework**: Open

Most commonly associated with the open source movement and entities such as Wikipedia, this model sees individuals contribute for no personal gain to a shared, productive enterprise. There is no revenue model per se, although many such projects accept donations to further their work. This is typically done out of an ethical commitment to bringing the digital good to the world for free. By definition, given this model functions on the basis of equal peers collaborating, it must use a multi-stakeholder governance model.
