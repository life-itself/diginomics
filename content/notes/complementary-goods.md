This model relies on the digital good being produced having at least one other good or service which is _complementary_ to it. Complementary goods and services are those which are consumed together. Think tea and milk or fries and tomato sauce. Companies may offer access to a digital good for free if they believe this will increase sales of another product or service. For example, a company may offer free access to its database if it is confident doing so will increase sales for the consultancy services it offers using the database. This model provides Open access to the digital good to maximize the potential market for its complementary good or service.
