Spending on medicinal drugs. Total spending on drugs in US or UK (and world) over time.

What i've found so far:

* Pharmaceutical spending - https://data.oecd.org/healthres/pharmaceutical-spending.htm
  * This has exactly data we need - though per capita not totals.
  * As of Jan 2017 only has data until 2014

## UK - NHS specific
