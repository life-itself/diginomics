The open world manifesto: a blueprint for an open information society.

# Manifesto (v2)

We are saving the lives of millions. We are opening the hearts and minds of children the world over. We are making a fairer, weller world.

We are doing this by changing the rules of the game of the information age. By transforming the way we share information, spurring innovation and opening up access to everyone.

Our commitment is an open world. A world where every single person has freedom to access, use, build on and share any piece of information without charge or permission, and, where innovators and creators are recognized and rewarded more than ever before.

We are doing this by changing the way we create and share knowledge. We are doing this by recognizing the way information is different because it is costlessly copyable -- different from bread and cars and the material things we have been used to. And that that difference makes a difference -- and it makes a different, better world possible. 

We believe there is a future where we *can* have the best of both worlds: universal, equitable free access to medicines and books, software and statistics **and** unprecdented levels of funding for innovation and creation of new medicines, books, software and data.

Let's make it happen.

# Manifesto v1

## The Open Knowledge Manifesto for an Open Information Society

> [!note]
> c. 2013/2014

We are committed to realizing the true potential of this digital information age by embracing the costless sharing of information.

Specifically, we are committed to creating an information society in which:

- All public (non-personal, non-private) information is open, free to everyone to use, share and build on
- All personal information about an individual is controlled and managed by that person
- Sharing and collaboration are the default ...
- [Everyone has the opportunity to gain the skills and attitudes to participate fully in a digital age]

Open means everyone has the freedom to use, build on and share the information.

Public: ...

=> Realizing the better outcome - the power and the possibility of open knowledge - will not be easy. It will take dedication and ambition, focus as well as breadth of vision, discerning collaboration and gradual scale.

* What
* Why
* How
* Who

A vibrant open knowledge commons empowering citizens and organisations and forming the basis for fair, enlightened and sustainable societies.

We want to create a digital world that is / fosters openness, freedom and opportunity.
What is the opportunity? The opportunity is freedom, insight, equality of opportunity, equality of power (democracy?), wisdom.

### What

Advocate and campaign for open knowledge to be created and used, through a global network of people and organisations

## SCQA

### Situation

The arrival of an information age powered by digital technology.

Information is nonrival and hence different from the rivalrous physical goods that have been the core of our economies and societies for thousands of years.

// the digital revolution is changing our lives. It is the most significant technology development we have ever produced. It will shape commerce and culture, the personal and the professional and everything in between. 

// It is especially significant because digital technology is *information* technology and information is fundamentally different from everything else we have ever produced.

### Complication

Information is both cheap to reproduce and costly to create in the first place.

How do we fund the first "copy"?

Current solutions focus on monopoly rights that exclude and restrict use, reuse and redistribution. This inefficiently denies access and retards innovation and creativity, and creates / worsens inequalities of wealth and power.

### Question

# Notes

## 2016-10-07

flourish, nourish ...

Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.

Give a man a medicine, you heal him today. Change the way we share knowledge, you give him access to medicines for a lifetime.

What Does an Open World Movement (OWM) do?

* Vision: Set out and communicate a broad and powerful vision for an open information future: Open info, open infrastructure, open minds
* Measure: Assess the state of openness worldwide and, in particular, whether progress is being made (is there more open information, is it being used and delivering value)
* Pressure / Evangelize: create broad awareness and a grass-roots movement for change
  * Specific network: Open World Network
  * Broader alliance and movement: inform and persuade other groups looking both at those where openness could be central to their work *and* those where it is only a part (cf environmentalism)
* Prototype and develop: Prototype demonstrator projects and act as an incubator for open databases and open information related tools
  * We need inspiring concrete examples
  * We need coordination of the information commons in its concrete form of databases etc

### Why?

Assumption / Claim 1: a move to an open information world will deliver major benefits in innovation, freedom and equity.

Examples:

* Double healthcare R&D and save $100bn at the same time in the US
* Create tens of billions of dollars of new value in media industries by opening up all music, books and movies -- making them freely available to everyone, anywhere -- whilst paying artists more using an alternative compensation system / remuneration rights approach.
* Improve the transparency, understandability and accountability of governments and societies around the world by opening up non-personal government information to citizens
* Accelerate innovation and societal value-creation in digital industries by moving to a default of openness in software, standards and data

Taking this assumption, our specific theory of change is as follows (working backwards)

1. Open information is used by (others) to create value
  * OWM have very limited involvement in this stage. This is a broad activity, today involving large portions of society.
  * OWM may engage to work with some users to understand and use open information and may occassionally design prototypes and demonstrators
2. Information made open by producer
  * Open information funded by government and others, new rules and regulations
    * [OWM] Design and implmentation of these rules
  * "Crowd-sourced" open information
    * [OWM] may help coordinate
  * Essential tools for this e.g. licenses, prototols and best practice, publishing platforms
    * [OWM] Some involvement here
3. Advocacy creates pressure and/or desire to open up information among stakeholders and decision-makers
  * Advocacy
  * Creating a movement to push sys
  * Embedding of these ideas into other groups and initiatives including political commitments
  * Template changes
4. Understanding of what open information is. Awareness of its benefits.
  * What is open, why should you do it.

In addition, it will be important to track and measure changes at all levels so that we can adapt and learn.

We want to create a digital world that is / fosters openness, freedom and opportunity.

What is the opportunity? The opportunity is freedom, insight, equality of opportunity, equality of power (democracy?), wisdom.

Situation: the digital revolution is changing our lives. It is the most significant technology development we have ever produced. It will shape commerce and culture, the personal and the professional and everything in between. 

It is especially significant because digital technology is *information* technology and information is fundamentally different from everything else we have ever produced.

A commitment to open knowledge means a commitment to:

- Open information: making all, essential, public interest information openly available - that is, free for anyone to use, share and build on.
- Open infrastructure: ensuring that all the essential infrastructure of the information age, from search to social networks, is built on software and data that is open to all - so that it can be understood, deployed and modified by anyone.
- Open minds: the purpose of digital technology is to support and enrich our lives. Information and technology on their own are of no value in themselves, their value comes from the well-being and wisdom they create and enable. Most importantly, a commitment to open knowledge is a commitment to use open information and open infrastructure to create "open minds", to develop freedom, self-expression, understanding, tolerance and insight that enriches individuals and societies.


Agriculture age: productivity change in food production. But limited and after the initial burst slow (if any). No economies of scale (much) => population growth, rent extraction and social stratification => cities and states.

Industrial age: specialization, economies of scale, capital (machines). Sustained productivity growth across all sectors. Focused on the physical. Making "things"

Information age: "infinite" economies of scale (all fixed costs), self-producing (machines produce machines, information produces information). Focused on the non-material (information), non-rival.

I am committed to realizing the true potential of this digital age by embracing the potential for costless sharing of digital information.

- Essential public-interest information is open, free to everyone to use, share and build on

- That personal data about individuals should be controlled and managed by them

- That sharing and collaboration are the default ...

## 2014-09-14 [a Manifesto for Open Knowledge as org]

We are here for the long-term, for the long-haul.

We will evolve.

It is certain that we will not be doing what we are today 30 or even 10 years from now but we do know that the questions around how we create and share knowledge in a digital age will only grow more important and that we want to play a key role in shaping the answers to those questions.

This digital world, built around bits, will continue to evolve at its own frenetic pace. But nevertheless there are some universals that will persist. We will build around those universals:

- Tech is there to help us, not the other way round
- Knowledge is power
- Non-rival is natural - open should be the default: In the digital world, the natural state for information is to be shared (openly)
- But, short-term, closure and control are king - the biggest bucks (short-term) are made through closure and control

=> Realizing the better outcome - the power and the possibility of open knowledge - will not be easy. It will take dedication and ambition, focus as well as breadth of vision, discerning collaboration and gradual scale.

We want to build something that is sustainable.

What is at the heart of that?

- A sustainable resourcing (revenue) model
- A long-term vision and purpose that is larger than any one of us

### What is the challenge?

Tension between:

- Growing slowly and ploughing one's own furrow (which other's may not support)
- Growing faster - aim to get economies of scale / name recognition / network effects. But means you may need to go with what others can support

In recent years I feel I have pushed for the latter, as there was a need to establish ourselves. Going forward we need to ask ourselves what we want to be.

### New Rules

- Every piece of tech we build that is funded has a payment option and a list of "monetization" ideas
  - Examples where we did *not* do this: OpenSpending, TimeMapper, DataHub, Textus ...
  - We want to build long-term small sustainable businesses. Repeat usage and sale.

**2016-12-08: this moved to dream-of-internet-is-dying* in +otb**

The Internet dream of digital technology was of openness, distributed freedom and collaborative creativity.

Instead, we are getting a technological infrastructure dominated by platforms which are proprietary, centralized and monopolized.

[[Instead, we are getting a technological infrastructure dominated by proprietarization, centralization and control.]]

[[Many of us are strongly attracted to the benefits of the marke]]

> Why does this matter (and the purpose of this essay).

This affects not just our purse but our freedoms.

And we have a choice. A choice between open and closed, between collaboration and control, between monopoly and [markets] freedom.

Our present danger is that the default of our current system will produce the bad [outcomes] not the good [ones].

To make the better choice is not easy - it will take conscious effort to reset the defaults, to put in place the principles and structures to ensure the better future.

This essay cannot make the change but it can lay out the problem and the path. [This essay is to set out why there is a problem and what we can do about it.]

Furthermore, achieving this change requires building support amongst a broad base. This, in turn can only come from creating change in our understandings and attitudes.

Specifically, market-based "competitive" capitalism has astonished us with its vibrancy and resilience. It has made us fall in love with the idea that market-based competition guarantees a good (and fair) outcome, driving up quality and driving down prices (for consumers).

But we over-estimate the power of competition in the digital age, for in the digital environment the "normal" outcome will be monopoly with competition relegated to the threat (all too rarely consumated) of "creative destruction" - that is the elimination of one monopoly and its replacement by another.

[[Creative destruction is both real but also ]]

## The problem of platforms

Digital information technology tend towards platform monopolies in a given vertical driven by the basic economics of network effects and economies of scale. The latter could be seen as benign - even if it tends towards monopoly - since it drives genuine efficiencies.

There also little we can do about network effects - the tendency to monopoly is still there. However, unlike with economies of scale, we can choose between competition "for the market" and competition "in the market" - with the latter being strongly preferable.

It is the network effect that we care about. We should distinguish here between direct effects - those of social networking or phone systems - and the indirect (and more ubiquitous) which arise from the two-sidedness of most digital environments. That is, there are 2 groups who need a common platform (think eBay with its buyers and sellers, or AirBnB with its renters and rentees etc). 

Two-side setups have existed throughout history - from the very first markets to modern newspapers - and similar to those today, they yield immense power and wealth to those who control them.

But the digital age is especia

Aside: much of the great monopoly wealth of the late 19th century phase of industrial capitalism came from exploiting economies of scale and scope. These deliver ... [[Whilst there was much abuse (and it is likely that scale was still far above the "minimum efficient")]]

The alternative: we should ensure that platforms are cooperatively owned and run

The platform, two-side extends even into basic software:

* (Direct network): my value of a given piece of softare is often increasing in the number of other users because I can 
* Indirect:
  * (Increasingly) a given app (or even tool) is not useful simply on its own but because of the set of complementary software (plugins, extensions, integrations) that exist. This is classic 2-sided stuff since plugin developers 
    * This is basic Microsoft monopoly basis
  * Finding developers and support: someone who is buying software may want to be able to locate capable developers

### Asides: The Weakness of Free Software

The Free Software movement was a brilliant "hack" - an attempt to use traditional IP system that supported proprietary, closed non-cooperative approach to drive an open distributed, collaborative commons.

Diluted by open-source - which re-packaged "free software" as simply an efficient way to leverage the economics of information goods like software (high fixed costs, zero marginal costs (aka non-rival)) for business advantage ("go with the grain rather than against it" sort of logic).

Nevertheless, it has been a brilliant success and an inspiration - collaborative creation of knowledge had been around for millenia (that *is* what culture is!), formal openness built on legal practice and hence suited to global scaling across distributed networks is somewhat new.

But its weakness is money.

In the digital economy there is a huge need to get to no. 1 fast. That means proprietary models, which thanks to their potential for customer lockin later, can promise more to investors and then use that to recruit up front by providing a shinier product, more sales-people etc.

How do we deal with this?

What about blending this with more explicit cooperative / club style models.

In some sense Free Software was already there - the GPL is a kind of simple but explicit cooperative contract - that was its genius. I'll share with you if you share with me.

OK, so what's been the problem. The issue is about the allocation of surplus. The proprietary model may have problems e.g. a) leads to immense inefficiences b) reinforces a broken competition over collaboration system c) over-allocates surplus to production (or rather leads to a casino capitalism in which lots of people bet, most lose and one goes home incredibly rich).

However: it does have some major pluses: a clear metric (profit), the use of the price system (a clear informative signal), alignment of incentives (revenue, profit and production) and, most fundamentally, a positive feedback loop between "success" (making money) and getting more resource to support growth.

The free/open model lacks most of this.

Put most simply the business model of "free/open" is broken. Not enough surplus gets captured to adequately fund development, especially for the big "platform" plays (which are the most significant). [Aside: The irony, of course, is that the platform model is actually very compatible with open if you can get it established cf Firefox or even (semi-open, definitely different) craigs-list]

How can we solve this? Can we take the "cooperatization" a stage further and tie it more explicitly into the business model?

> random thoughts follow

A. More explicit monetary contribution for those who can't contribute back. Formalize the "dual-licensing" model if you like.
B. Need to complement with an infrastructure / services play
C. Up-front funding - gov support. Just as government funds a large amount of R&D they could fund (in a sensible way) open-source service provision (at the very least, they could play a much more active role in mandating open standards etc that can reduce lock-in to proprietary platforms)

[Aside: the obvious criticism is that you'll lack the discipline coming the profit motive and the possibility of competition.]

# Aphorisms

Digital capitalism is casino capitalism: many bet, most lose and a tiny few go home rich.

NB: this was originally called the "Open Knowledge Manifesto".

First versions was drafted between 2012 and 2014 (based on earlier ideas).
