title: Pay What Feels Right
---

In keeping with the book's vision of an open world, I have chosen to make <em>The Open Revolution</em> openly and freely available to read and share.

At the same time, we still live in a closed world and [Remuneration Rights](/remuneration-rights/) don't exist (yet). Being open in a closed world is not easy to sustain. Thus, I invite you to make a financial contribution in recognition of the value you got from the book and to help us to increase our efforts to share a vision of an open world.

*Thank-you -- Rufus*
